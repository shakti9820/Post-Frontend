# Backend Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the backend of this project. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

```bash
# Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-backend-repo.git
cd your-backend-repo
npm install

# Start the Node.js server
node index.js

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up environment variables for the backend of this project. These variables are essential for configuring your Nodejs server.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your frontend project. Open the file and add the following environment variables:

```dotenv
# .env

# Set the MongoDB URI (replace with your MongoDB Atlas or Compass connection string)
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@cluster0.mongodb.net/your-database

# Set your JWT secret key for authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key





# Frontend Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the Frontend of this project. 


```bash
# Clone the frontend repository, navigate to the project directory, and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-frontend-repo.git
cd your-frontend-repo
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm start


This guide will walk you through the steps to set up environment variables for the frontend of this project. These variables are essential for configuring your React application.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your frontend project. Open the file and add the following environment variables:

```dotenv
# .env

# Replace 'your_react_app_key' with your desired value
REACT_APP_LOCALHOST_KEY=your_react_app_key

# Set the base URL for API requests
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000









# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
